Problem Statement:

1. Use the given link below and locate the bank marketing dataset. Data Set Link

Perform the below operations:

a. Is there any association between Job and Default?
Answer-
# For checking association between Job and Default we perform chisq test.
# We take Ho : There is no association between Job and Default.
chisq.test(Bank_data$job, Bank_data$default)

#Result
Pearson's Chi-squared test

data:  Bank_data$job and Bank_data$default
X-squared = 34.441, df = 10, p-value = 0.0001555

# Hence the p-value is less than 0.05, there is association between Job and Default at 95% confidence interval.

b. Is there any significant difference in duration of last call between people having housing loan or not?
Answer-
z <- aov(duration~housing, data = Bank_data)
summary(z)

# Result
              Df    Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)
housing        1     40656   40656   0.621  0.431
Residuals   4012 262537632   65438               
105 observations deleted due to missingness

# p-value = 0.431 is > 0.05 is greater than the cut-off value of 0.05 (duration & housing p-value = 0.431)
# are independent to each other.

c. Is there any association between consumer price index and consumer?
Answer -
cor.test(Bank_data$cons.price.idx, Bank_data$cons.conf.idx)

# Result
	Pearson's product-moment correlation

data:  Bank_data$cons.price.idx and Bank_data$cons.conf.idx
t = 2.944, df = 4117, p-value = 0.003258
alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.01531598 0.07626866
sample estimates:
       cor 
0.04583498

# p-value = 0.003258 and it is very much less than 0.05. So, we can reject the null hypothesis in favor of 
alternative hypothesis and conclude, that the variables, (job & Marital-p-value = 0.003258),
(con.price.idx, consumer are dependent to each other).

d. Is the employment variation rate consistent across job types?
Answer-
f <- aov(emp.var.rate~job, data = Bank_data)
summary(f)

# Result
              Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)    
job           10    278  27.784   11.69 <2e-16 ***
Residuals   4069   9671   2.377                   
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
39 observations deleted due to missingness

# p-value < 2.2e-16 is very much less than 0.05 so they are dependent to each other and are not dependent to each other.

e. Is the employment variation rate same across education?
Answer-
b <- aov(emp.var.rate~education, data = Bank_data)
summary(b)

# Result
              Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value   Pr(>F)    
education      6     62  10.375   4.295 0.000253 ***
Residuals   3945   9529   2.415                     
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
167 observations deleted due to missingness

# p-value = 0.000253 is very much less than 0.05 so employment variation rate is not same across education.

f. Which group is more confident?
Answer-
